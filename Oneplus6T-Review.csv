203,One plus 6t 8gb ram finally. Switched from iPhone 7,"The first impressions - One plus 6t(8gb ram and 128 GB storage).Initially thought to get One plus 7 and let me wait for May 14 launch. I was using Apple iPhone 7 from last 3 years and still there were no lags.But due to no customisations and speaker problems, wanted to get something good.Heard about Amazon sale and didn't thought twice to get this beast at 31499 including SBI discount.Well the battery, screen, lots of geetures and finally the absolute catchy screen takes eye out of mouth.One plus 7 could have been good but will surely come at an extra 10k mark. So, I was happy with this.Transferring files from iPhone to One plus was quick due to One plus switch.Thanks to Amazon for delivering this in less than 24 hrs and in a much secure way as, they asked me the OTP to deliver the package and that was something new with Amazon. I am loving this.",5

221,Awesome phone,I have been using one plus 3T before and upgraded to 6T and this one as well didn't disappoint me till now... Great phone... Great battery...,5
222,It's absolutely value for money!!!,"My son was waiting for Poco F2. As 6T was available for 31.5 k, we decided to go for this one.Delivery was super fast. Unit was intact.And it's absolutely beast.",5
223,Good,Improve finger print...,5
224,My slider wobbles,I don't know if it's just with me or all slider wobbles,4
225,After sales suck.,The only problem with the phone I'm facing is that my back panel got cracked a bit... I've trying to reach service centers for about a month now here in Delhi. They don't seem to have the back panel. They wont order one for one person and they never keep one In stock.. The phone's performance is tremendous... The only issue is after sales service which I'm not impressed with At all. They won't even provide contacts of higher authorities to help me with my claim. I'm a member of one plus community since 2017. Never had such a disappointing experience before. So before you buy keep this in mind...they may not have the spare parts to help you out if you need it.,3
226,Nice products,As good as we thought,5

232,Best phone in the market.,Writing this review after 4 months of use.The phone is super fast and handles all the task easily. Battery life is awesome and camera is the best in class.,5
233,Two weeks using the OnePlus 6T after switching from OnePlus 5.,"Upgraded to the One plus 6T (6GB/128GB) From my OnePlus 5. Here's my take:Coming from the OnePlus 5, which, for 3300 mAh has phenomenal battery life and screen on time, I had high expectations from the 3600 mAh unit on the 6T, the battery did bear pretty much anything that came it's way, and then some more. Will last you a full day with moderate usage with around 20% left in reserve.I'm really nit-picking here,you but the-display finger print scanner albeit being a novelty these days is not an ultrasonic unit on the 6T, but a tiny camera underneath the display that scans your print enhanced by a green flash Everytime you unlock your phone, therefore it's not as fast as the regular ultrasonic fingerprint scanner on my Old OnePlus 5, but that's not a drawback since Me, and all the prospective buyers will be using Face Unlock most of the time.Face unlock as usual, is blazingly fast, you just tap the unlock button and the phone will open instantly, (if pointed at your face) you won't even know there's a lock. It can read your face from a decent range as well.Camera quality is good enough, it takes awesome close up shots and portraits. Also the landscape shots are just amazing, no complains there. Haven't tried the night mode yet, will update as soon as I do.Overall this phone is a complete package deal, premium build quality, glass back, slight water resistance, and the display, the optic AMOLED FHD+ never disappoints, whether you're outdoors or indoors, in shade or sunlight, it always has optimum brightness and great viewing angles.The processor as we all know the Snapdragon 845 to be, is very powerful indeed, will render any game today and about two years from now in high details. No problem in gaming at all, no lag, and surprisingly no heating issues either. The 20W Dash Charger does a fantastic job at keeping the 6T topped up and ready for use, I get a full 0-100 in about an hour and 10 minutes.Rest assured, this handset will not disappoint you if you're looking for a flagship under 35k. Go for it!",4
234,Truly smart..,Flagship killer..‚ù§Ô∏è,5
235,As expected,Awesome,5
236,Worth for your money,Overall phone is so awesome.,5
237,Good,Good,5
238,Poor battery life which is unexpected from One Plus,"Bought this phone today, when the phone was put on charge, the battery started to reduce. After two or three tries, the phone finally started to charge but as claimed, it wasn't a rapid charging. I've been using one plus since 4-5 years, I haven't seen this before. Will be returning this product.",5
239,Please don't buy One Plus 6T,"With So much of Expectation Bought 1+6T .But Disappointedwith 15 Days of Experience. I will not Recommend this Product to my ColleaguesPls don't Opt for One Plus 6T""Error - can't Hold Calls"" - This Error Occurs when you call othersVery poor response from Customer Care",1

246,Happy,I brought this on 15 April for 37999/- every things going good but I'm facing little trouble on finger print.I brought 8+128gb combination but not as fast as I expected when compared to my Bros one plus 6t(6+128). I felt almost same. This is third week with my mobile I'll edit my review again if everything goes well.But u can happily go for this product and now the price is too low,5

250,Awesome,This handset has made my life awesome. It contains every feature i wanted for. Eagerly waiting for the next model.,5
251,Brilliant Phone,Everything about it is amazing. The only caveat being the not-so-accurate finger sensor inside the screen but that works well too. Worth the amount of money you're spending on it,5
252,Nice phone one plus 6t,Nice phone,4
253,Not worth for money,I bought it for 41999 from reliance storePros performance about Android version and hardware is awesomeCons-Camera quality is very low iphone 6 better than OnePlus 6t.Screen guard is not available in local market you have to order online and its not sure that it feet perfectly bcoz i have not got cut to cut dispay screen protector glass,3
254,Great phone but finger reader is slow.,Finger print reader,5
255,Average phone in One plus series,"1. Best thing about this phone is it's processor. Never hangs or irritates while opening, working and closing the apps.2. The screen resolution is good.3. Notch display is something new.  Nothing great about it but the screen utilization is good.Now the irritating facts:1. The finger print scanner is bad. It often needs more then one attempts to unlock the phone. I previously used One plus Two and it was awesome in this aspect even after 3 years.2. The placement of power button and the volume buttons is not good. They are placed on opposite sides and exactly at same position from top. Many time when I pressed power button with an imtention to off the screen, the volume down button on the opposite side also gets pressed accidentally and it takes the screenshot.3. Phone is a bit heavy.4. The battery lasts for more than a day for me, but that is not enough to impress for this price. Down the time after an year it will go down to less than a day.5. One plus does not have their own ancelaries and third party cases and screen guards are not reliable.6. The camera is just average. The quality is not even close to 4 year old Apple 6 plus phone.",3
256,Battery,Batter life very low.,4
257,Not Satisfied,"I was using oneplus 3 and now I purchased one plus 6T, but I am not satisfied with the product compared to oneplus 3 also though 6T has lots of extra features.Fingerprint sensor is not working correctly all the time.Battery life is also not good.Even mobile is also working slow and hangs sometime though I purchased just before 10 days.If company tells me to return the same and refund the amount, I will do that also.",1
258,Superb!!!,"The product is great, has good battery life, storage, is fast, camera is awesome, fingerprint reader is also good..overall happy with the product :)",5

271,3.5mm female port is much needed on cell phone devices,"Good product, but headphone converter quality is not good with in 3month it stoped working properly, 3.5mm port should be mounted in this device.....",4
272,Review,Portrait mode shots are not that good. PBattery life is goodfinger print sensing lot more to improveFace detection is supb,4
273,A bit over priced but good product,"What I like:1) The battery is sufficient. Works for me. The whole day passes easily and dash charging makes it even easier.2) Good screen, but the glossy nature causes reflection in bright lights causing a problem in viewing content. Brightening the screen helps a little.3) The camera is good, but you need to learn about different options. I am not sure why people are complaining about the camera. It is especially working fine after the night mode was introduced. Of course, lack of a telephoto lens is a sore point.4) The fingerprint is slow, but face recognition compensates for it. I have to test it on my brother to say about accuracy. But otherwise, it does work for me only.5) Good speed, smooth functioning, super sensitive touch.6) It comes with a protective cover and screen guard. Both good in quality. The screen guard is pre-applied. Less pain for me.dislike:1) For the price, they should have made it waterproof. One big drawback.2) For the price, they should have included stereo speakers. Another drawback.3) The adaptor allows you to use 3.5 headphones, but I got their bullet earbuds, so never tested. Headphones are not top notch but not bad either. The bullets should have been the part of the box.",4
274,kinda good enough,good phone for rough use,3
275,iPhone users please don't buy,Is good for gaming i play pubg the battery pack goes of quickly it would have been great if they were have given another slot for headphones,5

If you are not fond of photography then go for it. If you are buying this as ur primary phone thinking camera clarity in mind please dont even think about this phone. Just for normal games  movies songs and internet , you are definitely go for it because you have ample space to store all those",2

Now coming to the phone,Pros: face unlock is instantaneous, fingerprint reader is very fast, idk why they say it is slow. The display is a beauty, PUBG plays at 60fps, no heating at all after 1-1.5hrs of gaming, beautiful form factor. Amazing camera and good battery life+ fast charging.Cons: miss the headphone jack since bluetooth headsets mostly have some delay in sound transmission, using the type c to 3.5mm converter is just fine though, no wideangle photography, and no external sd card support which is a bummer",5

395,Brilliant Purchase,"This phone is worth all the money you pay.Battery Life is good.The display and interface is brilliant.I have been using it for 4 months and have been only impressed.The only issue is the fingerprint scanner,the fingers or the thumb needs to be in a particular angle so they the phone can be unlocked.Apart form the fingerprint sensor,the rest of the features of the phone are top notch.Worth the money you pay.",5
396,Consider buying one pluse 6T.,Packaging is good. Battery life is also good. Sleek and dynamic design.,5
397,Best FLAGSHIP you can get at this price,Writing this review after using the phone for 06 months.Pros:1. Build Quality excellent2. Camera superb3. Network reception is good4. Battery backup 7 hrs (I use it frequently for multiple tasks)5. Display is awesome... Nothing can beat AMOLED6. No lag and no sttuters. ( You can always expect high performance from a high end SoC like SD 845)7. Touch and Swipe : Smooth as butter8. OS and UI : Good but can be improved.9. Audio output is good.Cons:1. In-display fingerprint scanner is still in it's development phase so not as fast and relaible as the backside scanners.2.  I am FM lover and wonder which technology constraint is responsible for no FM reception in modern smartphones.3. IR blaster is a necessity and should be available in all smartphones.( My wish). So would have been better if they provided it.4. I know 3.5 Jack uses a lot of space and quality also suffers. But type C earphones are not that common in market upto this stage so it will take time to adjust.Finally very satisfied with One Plus 6T and it's really worth it's price,4
398,Best product,The product is worth the price.,5

402,Battery backup not good,Phone looks beautiful but the phone battery backup was not soo much good n phone getting heat while i use 10 min and within 1month I faced problems with this phone like battery problem phone heating etc...,4
403,Worth the price,The sound is loud and has a good quality . The display and camera are amazing,5
404,earphones,Not received any earphones,4
405,Good Phone but OnePlus 5 was better,"It's a very good phone but I had a OnePlus 5 prior to this and if I compare both then 5 had a better battery life, better finger print sensor and even it's Boca was better. Overall 6T has a better camera (except Boca) and better screen ratio. Speed and handling of both is the same",4
406,Ye bahut aachaa hai,Very good.thx.,5
407,Complete review,This product looks very nice but is finger print sensor is worst. It‚Äôs not working at all. Face lock quite good. After using 3 days I am modifying my review i am using iPhone 7 I thought to switch over android so I bought this product but it‚Äôs camera quality is not good in comparison to iPhone 7 I don‚Äôt play games yet it‚Äôs battery life max. 24 hrs. Processor is really fast. Looks good. I think I got defective product. I am going to get it replaced. And if this problem subsists with new device I will return this product and never shift to android.,3

417,Loved the product,"The phone which I always wanted to have.. worth the product worth the buy, costed well .. thank you Amazon for great deals ..",5
418,over hyped phone - sub standard camera. No so good performance,"Yes, it is true, this phone is really overhyped so many issuesCons1. 4K video recording crashes the camera app and restarts2. picture quality without pro mode is really average. It smoothens out images too much, big disappointment there. Doesn't use the full capabilities of twin cameras. In my opinion, this is the most hyped camera without performance to match. If Google pixel gets 90 marks out of 100 one plus 6t will get 40.3. Performance is just ok, sometimes take considerable time to open simple apps and do moderate demanding tasks4. You will find it bit heavy5. Multitasking not allowed (out of the box support not available)6. You will accidentally take a lot of screenshots due to the position of power and volume button (no research is done here)7. No so loudspeakers - an average quality I would sayPros1. The display is really good2. UI is big plus Overall, I regret my decision to buy this phone.  I would prefer Pixel 2 in the same price range.",3
